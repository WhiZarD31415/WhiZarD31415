- 👋 Hi, I’m @WhiZarD31415. I am a first year college student with majors in Computer Science (B.S.) and Applied Mathematics (B.S.).
- 👀 I’m interested in learning and developing my basic skills with programming and development in hopes of using these skills in my future profession (currently Artificial Intelligence is one of my hopefuls). In addition to programming, I also have a passion for mathematics and hope to combine the two in interesting ways.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the coding languages Python, Typescript, and C as well as understanding operating systems.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that I can apply my basic understanding of programing and potentially learn more complex concepts.
- 📫 How to reach me: preferably through my personal email connorvitz@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I am an avid fantasy reader and a rock climber!
